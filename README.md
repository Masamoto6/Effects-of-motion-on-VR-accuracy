# Unity VR Fitts' Law Experiment
# Fitts' Law in VR Under Motion Conditions
# A Unity-based VR experiment investigating how user motion affects targeting performance, using the Meta Quest 3 and (optionally) the YawVR motion simulator.

This project implements a target-shooting task in virtual reality based on Fitts' Law, designed to evaluate how physical motion influences interaction accuracy. Participants aim at targets of varying sizes and distances. Data on hit timing and position is logged to a CSV file for analysis. The system is designed to integrate with the YawVR motion simulator, though the core experiment also functions in a static setup.

System Requirements
Unity Version: 2023.2.6f1 or later

XR Plugin: Unity XR Interaction Toolkit

Input System: Input System Package (New)

Hardware: Meta Quest 3, Optional YawVR motorised Chair or other method of simulating motion

How to Run
Clone the repo to your PC.
Open the project in Unity Hub.
Load the scene named CoreVRScene or MainVRScene (whichever you used).
Connect your Meta Quest 3 using Oculus Link or Air Link.
Enter Play mode in Unity while wearing the headset.
Targets will begin spawningâ€”shoot them using the right-hand trigger.
Data will be saved on the desktop to a csv file.

Github repository is brand new because this is a backup after my latest commits weren't pushing properly and hitting a file limit. 
As of writing, everything works as intended.
